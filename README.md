# ZooMSS 2300

Use ZooMSS to assess the impacts of climate change on the structure of the global zooplankton community, and its role in mediating energy from phytoplankton to fish for long term simulations out to 2300.

## Datasets ##
Annual average surface chlorophyll (chlos), converted from phytoplankton carbon concentration (phyc) and surface temperature (tos) netcdfs for 
* historical (1850-2014)
* picontrol (1850 - 2014)
* ssp126 (2015-2300), 
* ssp534-over (2015-2300) and 
* ssp585 (2015-2300) climate simulations 

## Earth System Models Used
* CESM2, 
* IPSL-CM6A-LR, 
* UKESM1-0-LL earth system models. 

Required runs
For each dataset, we need to complete these runs:
1)	The standard model run, with all groups included
